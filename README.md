# mdinos-docker

The place for my docker containers. Well, there's only one. For now.

### rs-api

Grab data from S3 and serve to user.

### gke-test

A Python test API made for use as a Google Kubernetes Engine tester.

### nginx-test

An NGINX container build made to ensure that the GKE test container is working. Runs in the same cluster, with some terraform and kubernetes manifests in another repo.
